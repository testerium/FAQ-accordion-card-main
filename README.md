## My process

I finished the project in 5 hours. I had a little problem with the placement of the box image so that it was visible outside the container, but the final result was successful. I had also to rethink the function of closing the question when clicking on the next one, but I managed to do that as well (JavaScript). The project is suitable for desktop and mobile views.
